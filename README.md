## Glosary

**Symbol:** A stock symbol is a unique series of letters assigned to a security for trading purposes. Stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) can have four or fewer letters. Nasdaq-listed securities can have up to five characters. Symbols are just a shorthand way of describing a company's stock, so there is no significant difference between those that have three letters and those that have four or five. Stock symbols are also known as ticker symbols. [Learn more][1]

**PriceToEarningsRatio:** The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple. [Learn more][2]

**PriceToSalesRatio:** The price-to-sales ratio (Price/Sales or P/S) is calculated by taking a company's market capitalization (the number of outstanding shares multiplied by the share price) and divide it by the company's total sales or revenue over the past 12 months. The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the investment. [Learn more][3]

**EV_EBITDA:** The enterprise value (EV) to the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio varies by industry. EBITDA measures a firm's overall financial performance, while EV determines the firm's total value. [Learn more][4]

**EV_R:** The enterprise value-to-revenue (EV/R) multiple helps compare a companyâ€™s revenues to its enterprise value. The lower the better, in that, a lower EV/R multiple signals a company is undervalued. The EV/R multiple is also often used to determine a company's valuation in the case of a potential acquisition. It's also called the enterprise value-to-sales multiple. [Learn more][5]
